# Subject and Predicate

We name some person or thing; and
Say something about that person or thing.
In other words, we must have a *subject* to speak about and we must say or predicate something about the subject.
### Hence every sentence has two parts: 

## Subject
- The part which names the person or thing we are speaking about. This is called the **Subject** of the sentence.
## Predicate
- The part which tells something about the *Subject*. This is called the **Predicate** of the sentence.

## Rules Common: 

### 1. Subject usually comes first 
The Subject of a sentence usually comes first, but occasionally it is put after the Predicate; as. 
    - Here comes the bus.
    - Sweet are the uses of adversity.

### Normal order of a sentence:
Subject + Verb + Object

### Example:
- I am learning English.
- She likes reading.

### Here:
- Subject = who does the action
- Verb = the action

### 2. Imperative Sentences  
In imperative sentences, the **subject is not written**, but it is **understood**. 
- Sit down. [Here the subject *You* is understood.]
- Thank him. [Here too the Subject *You* is understood.]

| Sentence Type        | Subject Description        |
|----------------------|----------------------------|
| Normal Sentence      | Subject is clearly stated  |
| Imperative Sentence  | Subject is hidden (you)    |

### Summary : 
In most sentences, the subject comes first, but in commands (imperative sentences), the subject “you” is understood and not written.
